    <h1>Return and Refund Policy</h1>
    <p>Due to the nature of digital services (such as web development, design, and technical support), all sales are
        final once the service has been delivered.</p>
    <p>However, if there is a technical issue or error in the delivery from our side, we will work with you to resolve
        it. Refunds may be considered on a case-by-case basis within 7 days of delivery.</p>
